# Student Semester Attendance Analysis
Minor Project submission, Pandas based data analysis, developed as part of Minor-1 coursework, focused on understanding student attendance patterns during a semester, simple but meaningful analytical workflow.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes semester level attendance data of students across multiple departments, the main goal is to observe attendance distribution, compare departments, calculate statistical measures like mean and standard deviation, and visualize patterns using basic plots, data is synthetically generated to simulate real college attendance scenarios.

## Motivation and Purpose

Attendance plays a critical role in academic performance and eligibility, colleges often require minimum attendance criteria, this project helps in understanding how attendance varies across departments, identifying low, medium, and high attendance groups, and presenting insights in a simple analytical manner suitable for academic evaluation.

## Dataset:

The dataset is generated using NumPy and Pandas, number of students around 300, attributes include student_id, department, total_classes conducted, classes_attended, calculated attendance_percentage, attendance_status derived using logical categorization, departments considered are CSE, ECE, ME, CE, EE, data closely mimics real semester conditions.

## Tools: 

Python programming language, Google Colab environment, Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for data generation and numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, Gradio for simple interactive user interface, all tools selected as per minor project level expectations.

## Visualizations Included

Bar plot showing average attendance percentage for each department, distribution plot showing count of students under different attendance categories, plots are simple and clear, focused on interpretability rather than aesthetics.





## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a medium difficulty Pandas based analysis workflow, fulfills minor project requirements, balances simplicity with meaningful insights, and provides a clean foundation for further extension if required.
